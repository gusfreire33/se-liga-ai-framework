# Technical Planning Orchestrator

> **ARCHITECTURE REFERENCE:** Use `CLAUDE.md` as source of patterns.
> **LANG:** Respond in user's native language (detect from input). Tech terms always in English.
> **OWNER:** Adapt detail level to owner profile from status.sh (beginner -> explain why; advanced -> essentials only).

Coordinator for technical planning. Loads context, dispatches specialized subagents (Database, Backend, Frontend), consolidates plan with APPEND + VALIDATE + FILL GAPS, and validates 100% requirements coverage.

---

## Required Skills

Load `.claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md` before STEP 1 (schemas, IDs, universal doc rules). Apply `.claude/skills/sl-id-convention/SKILL.md` for ID/branch format.

---

## Yolo Mode

If argument contains `--yolo`:
- Skip ALL [STOP] points and clarification questions (STEP 6)
- Accept default scope automatically
- Do NOT ask for confirmation at any gate
- Execute to completion without human interaction
- Log all auto-decisions in console output

---

## GATES (Invariant Execution Blockers)

| Gate | Triggered at | Condition | Action |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| `feature_identified` | STEP 4 | FEATURE_ID is empty | List all features, WAIT for user choice, NEVER proceed without selection |
| `docs_loaded` | STEP 5 | about.md OR discovery.md missing | STOP, inform user, NEVER dispatch subagents |
| `scope_determined` | STEP 7 | Epic/Feature type unclear OR subagents unidentified | NEVER dispatch subagents, ALWAYS complete scope analysis first |
| `coverage_validated` | STEP 11 | Coverage < 100% | STOP, resolve gaps (add tasks or document exclusions), re-validate before finalizing |

---

## INVARIANT PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER write implementation code in plan.md (only contracts, schemas, structure)
- NEVER create subagents for components not in scope
- NEVER rewrite or summarize subagent outputs during consolidation (APPEND only)
- NEVER finalize plan without tasks.md AND 100% coverage validation
- NEVER execute subagents in parallel (SEQUENTIAL only, one at a time)

---

## STEPS IN ORDER

```
STEP 1:  Load founder profile     -> SILENT
STEP 2:  Run context mapper       -> FIRST COMMAND
STEP 3:  Load recent context      -> INTELLIGENT changelog reading
STEP 4:  Parse key variables      -> Feature detection (GATE: feature_identified)
STEP 5:  Load feature docs        -> about.md, discovery.md, design.md (GATE: docs_loaded)
STEP 6:  Clarification questions  -> IF NEEDED ONLY
STEP 7:  Analyze scope            -> Epic/Feature type + subagent selection (GATE: scope_determined)
STEP 8:  Execute subagents        -> SEQUENTIAL by area
  - 8.0: Cross-SF context (EPIC ONLY)
  - 8.1: Database Specialist
  - 8.2: Backend Specialist
  - 8.3: Frontend Specialist

STEP 9:  Test-Spec subagent       -> AFTER area subagents (TDD feature)

STEP 10: Consolidate plan         -> APPEND + VALIDATE + FILL GAPS + tasks.md + cross-SF review (EPIC ONLY)
STEP 11: Validate requirements    -> Coverage check (GATE: coverage_validated)
STEP 12: Validation Gate          -> feature-plan schema gate
STEP 13: Completion               -> Inform user
```

**Reuse feature ID:** `sl.plan` does NOT allocate a new ID. Read `id: [NNNN]F` from the feature's `about.md` frontmatter in STEP 5. The generated `plan.md` carries the SAME `[NNNN]F` with `related: [[NNNN]F]`.

---

## STEP 1: Load Founder Profile (SILENT)

Read `docs/owner.md` to determine communication style.

**IF profile exists:** Adjust communication style accordingly.
**IF not exists:** Use **Balanced** style as default.

**NEVER inform the user about this step. Execute SILENTLY.**

---

## STEP 2: Run Context Mapper (FIRST COMMAND)

Execute: `bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh`

Provides: BRANCH (feature ID, type, phase), FEATURE_DOCS (HAS_DESIGN, HAS_PLAN), DESIGN_SYSTEM, FRONTEND (component structure), ALL_FEATURES, RECENT_CHANGELOGS (last 5), HAS_EPIC, EPIC_CURRENT_SF, EPIC_PROGRESS.

**NEVER skip this script. ALL subsequent steps depend on its output.**

**Epic Detection:** IF `HAS_EPIC=true`, read epic.md, identify next pending SF (EPIC_CURRENT_SF), set scope to that SF only, load its about.md + shared discovery.md, and inform user: "Planning subfeature ${EPIC_CURRENT_SF} of epic ${FEATURE_ID}". IF HAS_EPIC=true AND no pending subfeature, NEVER plan—inform user all SFs complete and suggest `/sl.done`.

---

## STEP 3: Load Recent Context (INTELLIGENT)

**Cache Detection:** IF `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/past-features.md` exists, read it (cache). IF cache + discovery.md has section "Related Features", use as context and skip agent dispatch. Otherwise, dispatch Past Features Discovery Agent.

**Agent Dispatch (if needed):**
- **Agent:** @discovery-agent
- **Skill:** `sl-feature-discovery` Phase 1.5
- **Input:** about.md + RECENT_CHANGELOGS (from status.sh)
- **Output:** `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/past-features.md`

**Extract and Apply:** From past-features.md (cached or generated), identify:
- Files available for reuse
- Recently established patterns and technical decisions
- Correct codebase terminology for searches
- Implementation order respecting dependencies (`depends`)
- Related patterns (`shares-pattern` relation)
- Known conflicts (`conflicts` relation)

**Fallback:** IF past-features.md has no relevant matches, analyze RECENT_CHANGELOGS manually by keyword. IF match found and discovery.md doesn't reference it, read full changelog of that feature.

**Goal:** Use knowledge from recent deliveries to inform planning, avoiding reinventing the wheel.

---

## STEP 4: Parse Key Variables (GATE: feature_identified)

Extract from status.sh: `FEATURE_ID`, `CURRENT_PHASE` (must be `discovered` or `designed`), `HAS_DESIGN`, `HAS_FOUNDATIONS`.

**IF feature identified:** Display metadata and proceed to STEP 5.
**IF feature_identified gate fails:** Show feature list and WAIT for user choice. Ref: GATES table.

---

## STEP 5: Load Feature Documentation (GATE: docs_loaded)

**File loading matrix:**

| Type | Files to read | Priority |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Epic feature (HAS_EPIC=true) | `${SF_DIR}/about.md`, `${FEATURE_DIR}/discovery.md`, `${SF_DIR}/plan.md` (if exists), `${FEATURE_DIR}/epic.md`, `docs/design-system.md` (if exists) | PRIMARY |
| Normal feature | `${FEATURE_DIR}/about.md`, `${FEATURE_DIR}/discovery.md`, `design.md` (if HAS_DESIGN), `docs/design-system.md` (if HAS_FOUNDATIONS) | PRIMARY |
| Design data | Use design.md to inform backend contracts (endpoints serve UI needs) | IF HAS_DESIGN=true |

**Gate enforcement:** about.md AND discovery.md are MANDATORY. IF either missing, STOP and inform user. Ref: GATES table.

---

## STEP 6: Clarification Questions (IF NEEDED ONLY)

**ONLY ask questions if `about.md` and `discovery.md` leave critical decisions undefined.**

Present questions with options and a RECOMMENDED default. Format: `### 1. [Question]` with `- a) / - b)` options and `> RECOMMENDED: [x] - [reason]`. User answers with `1a, 2b` or `recommended`.

**IF no clarification needed:** Proceed directly to STEP 7.

---

## STEP 7: Analyze Scope & Determine Structure (GATE: scope_determined)

**Scope determination:**

| Condition | Scope | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| HAS_EPIC=true | Current subfeature only | Read ${SF_DIR}/about.md, do NOT plan entire epic |
| Normal feature | Entire feature | Read ${FEATURE_DIR}/about.md + discovery.md |

**Subagent selection matrix:**

| Keywords | Subagent | Create if |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| entities, tables, migrations, new data | Database Specialist | Feature needs data changes |
| endpoints, API, controllers, commands, events, workers, queues | Backend Specialist | Feature needs business logic |
| pages, components, UI, forms, hooks | Frontend Specialist | Feature needs UI changes |

**Decision rule:** Only create subagents the feature actually needs. Examples:
- Backend-only feature → Database + Backend Specialist only
- Full-stack feature → All three
- Simple UI change → Frontend Specialist only

**Inform user:** Type (FEATURE/EPIC), scope summary, subagent list. Ref: GATES table for scope_determined requirements.

---

## STEP 8: Execute Subagents (SEQUENTIAL)

**Execution rule:** SEQUENTIAL only. Wait for each subagent to complete before dispatching next.

**Output location:** Each subagent writes to: `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-[area].md` (temporary; deleted after consolidation).

---

### 8.0 Cross-SF Context (EPIC ONLY)

**IF HAS_EPIC=true:** Read epic.md dependency graph, identify consumers + providers of this SF, read their about.md + plan.md (if exists), build `${CROSS_SF_CONTEXT}` block below, and INJECT it into every subagent prompt:

```
## Cross-SF Context (EPIC -- read for integration awareness)

### Consumers (SFs that need data from this SF):
- **${SF_ID}**: ${1-line description of data needed}

### Providers (SFs that supply data to this SF):
- **${SF_ID}**: ${1-line description of data supplied} | Contracts: ${schemas/DTOs if plan.md exists}

### Integration rules:
- Schema fields MUST match consumer expectations
- Shared resources (enums, config vars, types) defined ONCE in earliest SF
- Document jsonb field structures when consumers depend on specific keys
```

**IF normal feature (no epic.md):** Skip this step. `${CROSS_SF_CONTEXT}` = empty.

---

### Subagent Bootstrap (shared across 8.1-8.3)

Every area subagent receives this bootstrap block before its specific task:

```
## TASK_DOCUMENTS (read ALL before starting -- source of truth)
${TASK_DOCUMENTS}

${CROSS_SF_CONTEXT}

## MANDATORY: Load Context (FIRST STEP)
1. Run: bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh
2. Read ALL files listed in TASK_DOCUMENTS above
3. Check for previous planning files: ls docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-*.md
```

---

- **Prompt:**
  ```
  You are the BACKEND SPECIALIST planning for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.

  ${SUBAGENT_BOOTSTRAP}

  ## MANDATORY: Load Backend Development Skill
  BEFORE designing endpoints, read skill `sl-backend-development` (RESTful API, IoC/DI, DTO naming, CQRS, multi-tenancy).

  ## Your Task
  Create the backend planning section covering: API, Commands, Events, Workers (if needed).
  Search the codebase for similar modules to use as references.

  ## Output Format
  Write to: docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-backend.md

  Use this EXACT format:

  ## Backend

  ### Endpoints
  | Method | Path | Request DTO | Response DTO | Status | Purpose |
  |--------|------|-------------|--------------|--------|---------|
  | [METHOD] | /api/v1/[path] | [DtoName] | [DtoName] | [2xx] | [~10 words] |

  ### DTOs
  | DTO | Fields | Validations |
  |-----|--------|-------------|
  | [CreateXxxDto] | field1: type, field2: type | field1: required |
  | [XxxResponseDto] | id, field1, createdAt | - |

  ### Commands
  {"CreateXxxCommand":{"triggeredBy":"Controller","actions":"Validate, persist, emit event"}}

  ### Events
  {"XxxCreatedEvent":{"payload":"id,accountId","consumers":"AuditWorker"}}

  ### Workers (if applicable)
  {"queue-name":{"job":"JobName","trigger":"Event/Schedule","action":"what it does"}}

  Reference: `[search codebase for similar module]`

  ## Rules
  - NO code examples, only contracts
  - MUST search codebase for similar module as reference (paths from CLAUDE.md)
  - Combine API + Workers in same section
  - Keep it under 60 lines
  - MUST follow skill `sl-backend-development` patterns
  - Include Status column in Endpoints table
  ```

---

### 8.3 Frontend Specialist

**DISPATCH AGENT: @frontend-agent**
- **Output:** `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-frontend.md`
- **Prompt:**
  ```
  You are the FRONTEND SPECIALIST planning for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.

  ${SUBAGENT_BOOTSTRAP}
  4. Read docs/design-system.md (if exists - tokens)

  ## Your Task
  Create the frontend planning section.
  **If design.md exists:** Follow its layout specs, component inventory, and mobile-first requirements.
  **If not:** Search the codebase for similar pages/components to use as references.

  ## Output Format
  Write to: docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-frontend.md

  Use this EXACT format:

  ## Frontend

  ### Pages
  | Route | Page Component | Purpose |
  |-------|----------------|---------|
  | /[path] | [PageName] | [~10 words] |

  ### Components
  {"ComponentName":{"location":"components/[folder]/","purpose":"~10 words"}}

  ### Hooks & State
  {"hooks":{"use[Feature]":{"type":"TanStack Query","purpose":"CRUD operations"}},"stores":{"[feature]Store":{"type":"Zustand","purpose":"Local UI state (if needed)"}}}

  ### Types (mirror from backend)

  Reference: `[search codebase for similar pages/hooks]`

  ## Rules
  - NO code examples, only structure
  - Types MUST mirror backend DTOs
  - MUST search codebase for similar files as references (paths from CLAUDE.md)
  - Keep it under 40 lines
  ```

---

## STEP 9: Test-Spec Subagent (AFTER area subagents)

**When to create:** ALWAYS -- runs after all area subagents complete.

**DISPATCH AGENT:**
- **Capability:** read-write
- **Complexity:** standard
- **Output:** `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-test-spec.md`
- **Prompt:**
  ```
  You are the TEST SPECIFICATION SPECIALIST for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.

  ## MANDATORY: Self-Bootstrap Context (FIRST STEP)
  1. Run: bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh
  2. Parse FEATURE_ID from output
  3. Read feature docs IN ORDER:
     - docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/about.md (PRIMARY -- RFs, RNs, RNFs)
     - docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/discovery.md
  4. Read area planning outputs (contracts):
     - docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-database.md (if exists)
     - docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-backend.md (if exists)
     - docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-frontend.md (if exists)

  ## Your Task
  Generate contract test cases derived from RFs/RNs in about.md + technical contracts from plan-*.md files.

  Rules:
  - Tests validate CONTRACT (input/output), NEVER internal implementation
  - Each RF generates at least 1 test case
  - Each RN generates positive AND negative test cases
  - Use nomenclature: [area]-[RF/RN]-[scenario]
  - Map test cases to test files

  ## Output Format
  Write to: docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan-test-spec.md

  Use the EXACT format from the test-specification skill:

  ## Test Specification

  ### Contract Tests (from RFs/RNs)

  | ID | Test Case | Area | RF/RN | Input | Expected Output | Verify |
  |----|-----------|------|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
  | T01 | [max 10 words] | [backend/frontend/database] | [RF/RN ID] | [request/action] | [response/result] | [assertion] |

  ### Test File Mapping

  | Area | Test File | Test IDs |
  |------|-----------|----------|
  | [area] | [path] | [T01, T02...] |

  ### Coverage vs Requirements

  | RF/RN | Test Cases | Covered? |
  |-------|------------|----------|
  | [RF01] | [T01, T03] | YES |

  ## Rules
  - NO implementation code -- only test specifications
  - Coverage vs Requirements MUST show 100%
  - Keep under 40 lines
  - Test cases are CONTRACTS: what goes in, what comes out
  ```

**NEVER skip this subagent. Test specs are MANDATORY for TDD pipeline.**

---

## STEP 10: Consolidate Plan (APPEND + VALIDATE + FILL GAPS)

**Philosophy:** Preserve subagent outputs (APPEND), ensure discovery/design completeness (VALIDATE), complete identified gaps (FILL GAPS).

**Schema load (MANDATORY):** Execute schema `feature-plan` from `.claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md`. Reuse `[NNNN]F` from about.md. Apply cache technique per skill.

### 10.1 Assemble plan.md

Create plan.md header: `# Plan: ${FEATURE_ID}`. Append subagent outputs in order (preserving original content):
1. plan-test-spec.md (if exists)
2. plan-database.md (if exists)
3. plan-backend.md (if exists)
4. plan-frontend.md (if exists)

Separate each section with `---`. **NEVER rewrite or summarize subagent content. Append directly.**

### 10.2 Validate Completeness

Read discovery.md and design.md (if exists). Verify:
- All entities/tables from discovery → complete schema in plan-database
- JSONB fields → detailed TypeScript structures
- Endpoints → complete request/response DTOs
- Events/workers → documented payloads and consumers
- Design components → mapped in plan-frontend
- States/interactions → defined hooks and stores
- Frontend types mirror backend DTOs
- Main flow is clear (call chain documented)

### 10.3 Fill Gaps

IF validation identifies gaps, ADD directly to plan.md. Common gaps:
- **Missing table schema** → Complete CREATE TABLE with all discovery fields
- **Missing JSONB structure** → TypeScript interface with detailed field types
- **Incomplete API contract** → Request/Response tables (Field | Type | Required | Description)

**Rule:** If discovery.md contains information, it MUST appear in plan.md in actionable form for developer.

### 10.4 Generate tasks.md (Architect Subagent)

**MANDATORY:** Load `.claude/skills/sl-tasks-checklist/SKILL.md` BEFORE dispatching.

**Dispatch:** @architecture-agent
- **Output:** `${PLAN_DIR}/tasks.md` (feature dir or subfeature dir if epic)
- **Prompt template:** From `sl-tasks-checklist` ("Architect Subagent Prompt Template" section), substituting `${FEATURE_ID}`, `${EPIC_CURRENT_SF}`, `${PLAN_DIR}`

**Rules:**
- tasks.md MUST have exact sections: `## Metadata`, `## Requirements Coverage`, `## TDD`, `## Execution`, `## Acceptance Checklist`, `## Quality Gates` (validators parse by text)
- plan.md FROZEN after this step (no spec checklist section)
- Every RF/RN in Requirements Coverage MUST link to ≥1 Acceptance Checklist item
- All checkboxes start as `[ ]` (no pre-ticking)

### 10.5 Cross-SF Integration Review (EPIC ONLY)

**IF HAS_EPIC=true:** After tasks.md generated, dispatch @architecture-agent for integration review.
**IF normal feature:** Skip to 10.6.

**Purpose:** Cross-validate all existing SF plans (schema mismatches, fragmented enums, missing config, undocumented handoffs).

**Checks to fix in-place:**
1. Schema ↔ Consumer Alignment (column names, jsonb, types match)
2. Shared Resource Centralization (enums/config added ONCE in earliest SF)
3. Cross-SF Handoff Contracts (each dependency edge documented)
4. Fallback & Degradation (SFs depending on unimplemented SFs have fallback behavior)
5. Worker/DI Registration (new services have DI tasks)

**Output:** Summary of changes (file + what changed) to stdout. NEVER create separate report file. ONLY fix integration issues. Preserve existing content. Keep each plan.md under 150 lines.

### 10.6 Add Navigation Sections

Append to plan.md: **Overview** (1-2 paragraphs from about.md), **Main Flow** (numbered Actor→Action steps), **Implementation Order** (Database→Backend→Frontend), **Quick Reference** (pattern→codebase search terms: Entity, Repository, Controller, Command, Hook, Page).

### 10.7 Cleanup Temporary Files

```bash
cd "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}"
rm -f plan-database.md plan-backend.md plan-frontend.md plan-test-spec.md
```

Delete only after plan.md complete AND coverage validated.

---

## STEP 11: Validate Requirements Coverage (GATE: coverage_validated)

**Extract** all RFs, RNs, and Scope items from discovery.md. **Map** each requirement to Feature/Area and specific tasks. **IF no task exists → CREATE task or JUSTIFY exclusion.**

**Generate coverage table** in plan.md:

| ID | Requirement | Covered? | Feature/Area | Tasks |
|----|-------------|----------|--------------|-------|
| RF01 | User creates account | YES | Backend + Frontend | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 |
| RF05 | Admin toggle RLS | EXCLUDED | - | Out of scope — validated with user |

**Validation:** IF Coverage = 100% → Proceed to STEP 12. IF Coverage < 100% → STOP, resolve gaps (add tasks or document exclusions), re-validate. Ref: GATES table.

---

## STEP 12: Validation Gate

Execute validation gate from `.claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md` for schema `feature-plan`. ⛔ DO NOT skip. Require `PASS` before proceeding.

---

## STEP 13: Completion

Inform user with summary:
- Feature ID and plan path
- Areas planned (Database/Backend/Frontend)
- Key metrics (endpoint count, task count, RF/RN count)
- Suggested next command: read `sl-ecosystem` Main Flows section to determine `/sl.build`, `/sl.autopilot`, or `/sl.design`

---

## Execution Rules

| Rule | Category |
|------|----------|
| Keep final plan.md under 150 lines | Size constraint |
| Use tables for all structured data (not prose) | Readability |
| Reference similar files instead of writing code | Patterns |
| Create only subagents the feature actually needs | Scope |
| Execute subagents SEQUENTIALLY (not parallel) | Ordering |
| Delete temporary plan-*.md files after consolidation | Cleanup |
| Load skill files before planning each area | Prerequisites |
| Append subagent outputs without rewriting | Preservation |
| Validate 100% requirements coverage before finalizing | Gate enforcement |
