# Delivery Validation

Skill for PRODUCT validation — checks whether requirements were 100% implemented.

## When to Use

- Before `/sl-done` (final gate)
- After `/review` (complementary)
- When the feature appears ready

**Difference from code-review:**

| code-review (Technical) | delivery-validation (Product) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| IoC, SOLID, security | RF/RN implemented? |
| Type contracts | Acceptance criteria passing? |
| Build compiles? | Functionality works end-to-end? |
| Technical patterns | Implicit dependencies created? |

### When NOT to Use

- During development (run only when feature appears ready)
- To validate code quality (use `code-review` instead)
- Without a defined `about.md`
- For planning or discovery work

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Load Requirements

```bash
# Identify current feature
FEATURE_ID=$(bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh)

# Load specification
cat docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/about.md
cat docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan.md 2>/dev/null  # Contracts (prose)
cat docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/tasks.md 2>/dev/null # Tick state (## Acceptance Checklist)
```

**Extract from about.md:**
- **RF (Functional Requirements):** What the system MUST do
- **RN (Business Rules):** Conditions and behaviors
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Testable checks
- **Included Scope:** What IS part of the delivery

**Extract contracts from plan.md (prose) + tick state from tasks.md → ## Acceptance Checklist:**

From `plan.md` (prose): routes, services, DTOs, guards, migrations, queues — as defined in the plan.
From `tasks.md → ## Acceptance Checklist`: a checklist where each item ends with `(RFNN/RNNN)` reference and carries `[ ]`/`[x]`/`[!]` tick state set by `sl.build`/`sl.autopilot` validators.

Map each `## Acceptance Checklist` item to the corresponding RF/RN from `about.md`. Use `## Requirements Coverage` from `tasks.md` as a derived index — every RF/RN must have coverage by ≥1 item from `## Acceptance Checklist`.

IF `tasks.md` or `## Acceptance Checklist` does NOT exist (legacy feature, pre-PRD0014):
- BLOCK validation. The feature was not planned with the current schema; there is no automatic fallback.
- Warn: "tasks.md missing or has no ## Acceptance Checklist — feature must be replanned via /sl.plan."

### Phase 2: Build Validation Checklist

**For EACH requirement, create a verifiable item:**

```markdown
## Requirements Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **RF01:** [description] → [how to verify]
- [ ] **RF02:** [description] → [how to verify]

### Business Rules
- [ ] **RN01:** [condition] → [expected result]
- [ ] **RN02:** [condition] → [expected result]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [criterion 1] → [how to test]
- [ ] [criterion 2] → [how to test]
```

### Phase 3: Verify Prerequisites (CRITICAL)

**For EACH requirement, analyze implicit dependencies:**

```markdown
## Prerequisites Analysis

### RF01: "Check product tier before allowing download"
**Dependency analysis:**
1. Does Product need a `tier` field? → [VERIFY in model]
2. Is there a flow to assign tier? → [VERIFY endpoints]
3. Is tier already populated? → [VERIFY data]

**Status:**
- [ ] tier field exists on Product → ✅/❌
- [ ] Assignment flow exists → ✅/❌
- [ ] Data is consistent → ✅/❌
```

**Key questions for each requirement:**
- "What MUST exist for this to work?"
- "What data/fields are needed?"
- "What dependent flows are needed?"
- "What integrations are needed?"

### Phase 3.5: Validate Acceptance Checklist (tasks.md → ## Acceptance Checklist)

**For EACH item in ## Acceptance Checklist, cross-check tick state vs reality:**

| Item (with RF/RN ref) | Tick state | Expected (from plan.md) | Found | Status |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------------------|-------|--------|
| Route POST /billing/webhook/:provider returns 200 (RF02) | [x] | WebhookController.handleWebhook() | POST /webhook (fixed) | ⚠️ DIVERGENT |
| Service WebhookNormalizerService is provider-agnostic (RF02) | [!] | generic, provider-agnostic | StripeWebhookService | ❌ MISSING |
| DTO WebhookEventDto exposes {provider, payload, signature} (RF02) | [ ] | {provider, payload, signature} | WebhookDto {payload} | ⚠️ DIVERGENT |

**Status per item:**
- ✅ **COMPLIANT:** tick `[x]` AND implementation matches plan.md prose
- ⚠️ **DIVERGENT:** tick `[x]` but implementation differs from plan.md (validator was wrong OR drift after tick)
- ❌ **MISSING/FAILED:** tick `[!]` (validator already marked failure) OR tick `[ ]` still pending
- 🚨 **STALE TICK:** tick `[x]` but code does not exist — blocks delivery; reopen tick

**Mandatory cross-reference:** Do all RF/RN from `## Requirements Coverage` (tasks.md §1) have a corresponding item in `## Acceptance Checklist` (tasks.md §4)?
- IF yes → validation is deterministic (checklist-driven)
- IF gap → document which RF/RN are uncovered — architect failure when generating tasks.md, requires regenerating via /sl.plan

### Phase 4: Validate Implementation

**For EACH checklist item (about.md + tasks.md → ## Acceptance Checklist):**

1. **Locate code that implements it** (`grep -r "[key-term]" apps/ libs/ --include="*.ts"`)
2. **Verify the logic is correct** — RN conditions implemented? Edge cases handled? Full end-to-end flow?
3. **Mark status:**
   - ✅ **Implemented:** Code exists and is correct
   - ⚠️ **Partial:** Implemented but incomplete
   - ❌ **Not implemented:** Completely missing
   - 🔗 **Missing prerequisite:** Dependency does not exist

### Phase 6: Generate Report

**Output: validation-report.md**
