# Feature Code Review Specialist

> **AUTO-CORRECTION RULE:** The reviewer MUST automatically apply ALL identified corrections. Only finalize when code is 100% correct.
> **LANG:** Respond in user's native language (detect from input). Tech terms always in English.
> **OWNER:** Adapt detail level to owner profile from status.sh (beginner → explain why; advanced → essentials only).

Coordinator for feature code review. Dispatches specialized reviewers (Frontend + Backend) in parallel, consolidates findings, auto-corrects all violations, verifies build, and outputs structured report to console.

---

## Yolo Mode

If argument contains `--yolo`: Skip STEP 1, auto-stage all, auto-correct without confirmation, execute to completion, log all auto-decisions.

---

## MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION

**STEPS IN ORDER:**
```
STEP 1: Pre-Review Setup        → CHECK unstaged, ASK user
STEP 2: Bootstrap Context       → status.sh, load docs, load CLAUDE.md, read changed files
STEP 3: Spec Compliance Audit   → Deep plan.md vs code (BEFORE technical review)
STEP 4: Dispatch Reviewers      → PARALLEL (Frontend + Backend via Task)
STEP 5: Consolidate Findings    → Merge, deduplicate, aggregate, score
STEP 6: Build Verification      → npm run build, fix until passing
STEP 7: Validation Gates Re-Run → INDEPENDENTLY re-run every gate from CLAUDE.md (do NOT trust ticks)

STEP 8: Quality Gate Report     → Create review.md + console output
```

---

## GATES AND PRECONDITIONS

All gates must be checked sequentially before proceeding to the next step. Gate failures block progress. Prohibitions below replace all conditional blocks throughout the document.

### Gate 1: Implementation Complete (STEP 1)

**Validation:** Feature code exists with minimum required documentation.

| Condition | Required | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Feature code exists | Committed, staged, or unstaged | Check working directory |
| `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/about.md` | Yes | Validate exists |
| `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan.md` | Recommended | Warn if missing (non-blocking) |

**Success Criteria:** about.md exists.
**Failure:** STOP. Inform user to complete implementation first.

### Gate 2: Context Fully Loaded (STEP 2)

**Validation:** All project context available before dispatching reviewers.

| Context | Source | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Feature metadata | `bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh` | FEATURE_ID, CURRENT_PHASE, FILES_TO_REVIEW |
| Feature docs | `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/*` | about.md, discovery.md, plan.md, design.md (opt), iterations.jsonl, decisions.jsonl |
| Project patterns | `bash .codesl/scripts/pattern-search.sh [area]` (if PROJECT_SKILL) | Frontend, Backend, Database patterns |
| Architecture reference | `CLAUDE.md` | Config, DI, repo, CQRS, naming, multi-tenancy, security, file structure |
| Changed files | `git diff --name-only` + read each file | ALL files from FILES_TO_REVIEW |

**Success Criteria:** ALL context loaded. Proceed to STEP 3.
**Failure:** Rerun context loading. Do NOT dispatch reviewers.

### Gate 3: Spec Compliance Audit Complete (STEP 3)

**Validation:** plan.md contracts match implementation before technical review.

| Audit Phase | Checklist |
|-------------|-----------|
| Load contracts | Extract routes, services, DTOs, guards, queues from plan.md prose |
| Load acceptance checklist | Read `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/tasks.md` → `## Acceptance Checklist` with tick state `[ ]/[x]/[!]` |
| Validate requirements coverage | `## Requirements Coverage` section must exist mapping RF/RN to checklist items |
| Execute audit | For each checklist item: locate impl (file:line), validate behavior, compare vs about.md (RF/RN), record status |
| Cross-reference | All RF/RN from about.md appear in coverage section; all RF/RN have ≥1 checklist item |

**Status Taxonomy:**
- `COMPLIANT`: Tick `[x]` AND matches plan.md name/type/behavior
- `DIVERGENT`: Tick `[x]` but differs from spec (describe gap)
- `FAILED`: Tick `[!]` (validator flagged); confirm reason
- `PENDING`: Tick `[ ]` (not implemented)
- `STALE TICK`: Tick `[x]` but code missing → reopen, block delivery

**Success Criteria:** `SPEC_AUDIT_STATUS = COMPLIANT` (>80% items compliant, no STALE_TICK, no UNCOVERED RF/RN).
**Failure:** Audit status = `DIVERGENT` or `INCOMPLETE`. Report findings; do NOT dispatch reviewers until resolved.

**Special Cases:**
- `tasks.md` OR `## Acceptance Checklist` missing → STOP. Report "Feature missing tasks.md/##Acceptance Checklist — must replan via /sl.plan".
- All RF/RN covered but some items divergent → Proceed (marked ⚠️ in report).

### Gate 4: Reviewers Dispatched and Complete (STEP 4-5)

**Validation:** Backend and Frontend reviewers must complete before consolidation.

| Condition | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Preconditions | Gates 1-3 PASSED. Context fully loaded. Spec audit complete. |
| Dispatch rule | Detect scope: frontend files → dispatch frontend; backend/libs files → dispatch backend; both → dispatch both in parallel |
| Blocking condition | ANY finding with unclear root cause → Load `sl-investigation` skill, apply Phase 3 differential diagnosis before classifying severity |
| Completion requirement | ALL reviewers must return with findings before STEP 5 consolidation |

**Success Criteria:** All dispatched reviewers complete with findings consolidated.
**Failure:** Rerun missing reviewers. Do NOT proceed to build verification.

### Gate 5: Build Passes (STEP 6)

**Validation:** Code compiles after reviewer corrections.

| Step | Action | Condition |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Run build | `npm run build` | Expected: exit code 0 |
| Build fails | Review errors, auto-fix, re-run | Repeat until passing |
| Idempotency | Do NOT re-dispatch reviewers after build fix | Fixes are follow-up corrections, not re-review |

**Success Criteria:** Build exits 0, no errors.
**Failure:** Build fails. Fix errors. Re-run build. Do NOT proceed to STEP 7 until build passes.

### Gate 6: Startup Test Passes (CONDITIONAL - if feature enabled)

**Validation:** Application starts without DI/IoC configuration errors.

| Condition | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| When applicable | STEP 6 feature injection enabled (see `` markers) |
| Success | Exit code 0 (or connection errors are acceptable — ignore) |
| Failure | Exit code 1 AND non-connection error (DI/IoC error) → Fix error, re-run test. Do NOT write review.md. |
| Not applicable | Feature not enabled → Skip this gate; note as "SKIPPED" in Quality Gate Report |

**Success Criteria:** Test passes (exit 0) or only connection errors detected.
**Failure:** Non-connection error. Fix DI/IoC configuration. Do NOT write review.md until passing.

### Gate 7: Validation Gates Re-Run Independently (STEP 7)

**Validation:** Every gate from CLAUDE.md `validation_gates` block re-executed in current session.

| Condition | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Precondition | Build passes (Gate 5). STEP 7.5 (iteration logging) completed if files modified. |
| Load gates | Read CLAUDE.md `validation_gates` block. If missing → emit one-line nudge and skip rest of STEP 7. |
| Re-run procedure | For each `(intent, command)` in block: invoke via Bash, capture stdout/stderr/exit code in this session |
| Exit 0 | Confirm `[x]` (or upgrade `[!]`/`[ ]` to `[x]`) |
| Exit ≠ 0 | Partition failures into `TOUCHED_FAILURES` (git diff --name-only) vs `UNTOUCHED_FAILURES` |
| TOUCHED_FAILURES | Downgrade tick to `[!] — REASON: <≤120 chars>`. **Mark review BLOCKED.** Do NOT auto-fix (report to user). |
| UNTOUCHED_FAILURES only | Keep `[x]`. Refresh `### Known Issues` section (cap 10 items + `+N more`). |
| Write tasks.md | Update with new tick state and exit code pairs |
| Idempotency | Do NOT re-dispatch reviewers. Gate failures are validator job, not review job. |

**Success Criteria:** All touched gates exit 0. No `[!]` marks on touched files.
**Failure:** Any `[!]` on touched file. Mark review BLOCKED. Report reason to user.

**Special Cases:**
- CLAUDE.md has no `validation_gates` → Emit nudge: "Note: validation_gates not detected in CLAUDE.md. Run /sl.xray to enable validation gates." Skip rest of STEP 7.

### Gate 8: Review Document Writable (STEP 8)

**Validation:** review.md must write successfully before console output.

| Step | Action | Condition |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Collect data | Build: status from STEP 6. Spec: status from STEP 3. Scores: from STEP 5. Gates: from STEP 7. |
| Build table | Quality Gate Report (see STEP 8.1) |
| Write review.md | `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/review.md` with all consolidated findings |
| Idempotency | If review.md already exists → back it up as `review.md.prev`, write new |

**Success Criteria:** review.md written with all gates populated.
**Failure:** Write fails. Do NOT output console report. Debug and retry.

---

## PRE-EXECUTION PROHIBITIONS

These prohibitions replace all scattered conditional blocks and prevent common mistakes:

| Prohibition | When | Alternative |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Do NOT dispatch reviewers (Task) | Implementation NOT complete (Gate 1) | Stop and inform user to complete first |
| Do NOT write spec audit output | Context NOT loaded (Gate 2) | Load all docs and CLAUDE.md first |
| Do NOT dispatch reviewers (Task) | Spec audit NOT complete (Gate 3) | Execute Spec Compliance Audit first |
| Do NOT proceed to STEP 7/8 | Build failing after fixes | Fix build errors until 100% passing (Gate 5) |
| Do NOT write review.md | Startup test fails with DI error | Fix DI/IoC configuration, re-test (Gate 6) |
| Do NOT trust ticks on Validation Gates | Existing `[x]` marks in tasks.md | Re-run every gate command independently (Gate 7) |
| Do NOT mark review READY | Any gate red on touched file after re-run | Report gate failure; block review (Gate 7) |
| Do NOT skip review silently | CLAUDE.md has no validation_gates | Emit one-line nudge; continue review (Gate 7) |
| Do NOT use Bash git commit | Any point in workflow | Use /sl-commit skill instead |
| Do NOT stage files silently | Pre-Review Setup (STEP 1) | Ask user permission first via AskUserQuestion |

---

## STEP 1: Pre-Review Setup

### 1.1 Check for Unstaged Changes

Check working directory for unstaged/untracked changes.

**If there are unstaged changes:**

Use AskUserQuestion tool to ask the user:

```
Detected uncommitted changes in your working directory.

To include the changes in the next commit along with review corrections, I can stage them (git add).

Can I stage your changes?
- Yes: I stage and proceed with the review
- No: I keep as-is and proceed (changes remain unstaged)
```

**If user agrees (Yes):**
```bash
git add -A
```
Save `STAGED_CHANGES=true` for tracking.

**If user declines (No):**
Proceed with review. Save `STAGED_CHANGES=false`.

**If no unstaged changes:**
Proceed directly. Save `STAGED_CHANGES=false`.

### 1.2 Validate Implementation Complete (Gate 1)

- Feature code exists (committed, staged, or unstaged)
- `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/about.md` exists
- `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan.md` exists (recommended)

**IF implementation is NOT complete:** Inform user and STOP.

---

## STEP 2: Bootstrap Context

### 2.1 Detect Current Feature

```bash
bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh
```

**Parse the output to get:**
- `FEATURE_ID`
- `CURRENT_PHASE`
- `FILES_TO_REVIEW` (consolidated list of all changed files)

**Feature identified:** Display and proceed automatically.
**No feature:** If ONE exists, use it; if MULTIPLE, ask user.

### 2.2 Load Feature Documentation

List the feature docs directory, then **load ALL documents IN ORDER:**
1. `about.md` - Feature specification (EXTRACT: RF, RN, Acceptance Criteria)
2. `discovery.md` - Discovery insights (CHECK: Prerequisites Analysis)
3. `plan.md` - Technical plan (PRIMARY - verification checklist)
4. `design.md` - UX design (if exists)
5. `iterations.jsonl` - Implementation history (JSONL: what was implemented, pivots, areas touched)
   - Each line: `{"ts":"...","agent":"...","type":"...","slug":"...","what":"...","files":["..."]}`
   - Use to understand: implementation sequence, which areas were modified, any pivots/corrections
   - Cross-reference with changed files to validate completeness
6. `decisions.jsonl` - Pivot decisions (if exists, check for areas with multiple pivots = extra review attention)
7. Load project patterns for validation:
   - IF `PROJECT_SKILL` in script output: run `bash .codesl/scripts/pattern-search.sh --list` to see areas, then `pattern-search.sh [area]` for each relevant area to get topic ranges. Read only topics related to the changed code.
   - IF `PROJECT_DOCS` in script output: read ALL listed project pattern files
   - These contain implementation patterns to validate against

### 2.3 Load Project Architecture Reference

Read CLAUDE.md and **extract from specification:**
- Configuration patterns (env vars, configs)
- DI patterns (service injection)
- Repository patterns
- CQRS patterns (if applicable)
- Naming conventions
- Multi-tenancy rules (if applicable)
- Security rules
- Expected file structure

**CLAUDE.md is the source of truth** for validating code.

### 2.4 Read ALL Changed Files (Gate 2)

From `status.sh` output, read ALL files in `FILES_TO_REVIEW`.

**IMPORTANT:** Review must cover ALL changed files (committed, staged, unstaged, untracked).

---

## STEP 3: Spec Compliance Audit (BEFORE technical review)

**Deep audit of plan.md spec vs implemented code. Catches gaps the code review does not.**

### 3.1 Load Contracts and Acceptance Checklist

```
READ docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/plan.md
  → Extract contracts from prose:
    - Routes: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE + path patterns
    - Services: Service/Handler/Adapter class definitions
    - DTOs: Dto/Request/Response class definitions
    - Guards: Guard class definitions
    - Queues: queue/processor/worker references

READ docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/tasks.md → section `## Acceptance Checklist`
  → Each item ends with `(RFNN/RNNN)` reference and carries [ ]/[x]/[!] tick state
  → Use as deterministic audit source — pairs each contract with its RF/RN coverage and tick state

READ docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/tasks.md → section `## Requirements Coverage`
  → Derived RF/RN tick state — used in cross-reference
```

**IF tasks.md OR `## Acceptance Checklist` ABSENT:** Stop and report "Feature missing tasks.md/##Acceptance Checklist — must replan via /sl.plan".

### 3.2 Execute Audit (ALL areas)

For EACH item in `## Acceptance Checklist`:

```
a. LOCATE implementation with file:line (cross-reference contract from plan.md prose)
b. VALIDATE not just existence but BEHAVIOR:
   - Route: exists AND accepts correct params (path variables, query, body)?
   - Service: generic/adapter-based as spec OR hardcoded to specific provider?
   - DTO: has ALL specified fields with correct types?
   - Guard: applied at correct scope?
   - Queue: processes events as described?
c. COMPARE with about.md: does the item satisfy the RF/RN referenced in `(RFNN/RNNN)`?
d. STATUS per item (cross-check tick state vs reality):
   COMPLIANT     — tick `[x]` AND matches plan.md prose in name, type, behavior
   DIVERGENT     — tick `[x]` but differs from spec (describe exact gap; possibly stale tick)
   FAILED        — tick `[!]` (validator already flagged); inspect REASON, confirm or escalate
   PENDING       — tick `[ ]` (not yet implemented)
   STALE TICK    — tick `[x]` but code missing — re-open tick, block delivery
```

### 3.3 Cross-Reference

```
Do ALL RF/RN from about.md appear in tasks.md → ## Requirements Coverage?
Do ALL RF/RN have at least one ## Acceptance Checklist item referencing them via `(RFNN/RNNN)`?
  → COVERED:   RF/RN has corresponding checklist item(s)
  → UNCOVERED: RF/RN has no checklist item — architect failed at /sl.plan; requires replan
```

### 3.4 Spec Audit Output (Gate 3)

Output the audit as a table with columns: Item, Type, Expected, Found at, Status. Include summary counts (COMPLIANT/DIVERGENT/MISSING), RF/RN coverage, and compute SPEC_AUDIT_STATUS:
- `COMPLIANT`: >80% items compliant, no STALE_TICK, no UNCOVERED RF/RN
- `DIVERGENT`: Some items divergent but no show-stoppers
- `INCOMPLETE`: Show-stoppers present (STALE_TICK, UNCOVERED RF/RN)

**IF SPEC_AUDIT_STATUS ≠ COMPLIANT:** Report findings to user. Do NOT proceed to STEP 4 until resolved.

---

## STEP 4: Dispatch Specialized Reviewers (PARALLEL)

### 4.1 Detect Scope

Based on changed files, determine which reviewers to dispatch:
- **frontend**: `apps/frontend/**` detected
- **backend**: `apps/backend/**` OR `libs/**` detected

### 4.2 Dispatch Strategy

**If BOTH frontend and backend files exist:**
- Dispatch BOTH reviewers in PARALLEL (single message, multiple Task calls)

**If only ONE area exists:**
- Dispatch single reviewer

**Always wait for ALL reviewers to complete before proceeding.**

**Idempotency:** Do NOT re-dispatch reviewers if a build fix occurs (see Gate 5 note).

---

### DISPATCH AGENT: @reviewer-agent — Frontend Review

**Intent:** Review frontend code quality, patterns, and UX implementation for the feature.

```

```

---

### DISPATCH AGENT: @reviewer-agent — Backend Review

**Intent:** Review backend code quality, architecture, security, database, and product completeness for the feature.

```
description: "Review Backend for ${FEATURE_ID}"
prompt: |
  ## ROLE
  You are the BACKEND REVIEWER for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.

  ## BOOTSTRAP
  1. Run: bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh
  2. Read ALL files listed in TASK_DOCUMENTS
  3. IF PROJECT_SKILL: bash .codesl/scripts/pattern-search.sh backend,database; IF PROJECT_DOCS: read matching files
  4. Read changed files: [list from FILES_TO_REVIEW with apps/backend/** OR libs/** pattern]
  5. Read skills: sl-backend-development (PRIMARY), sl-database-development, sl-code-review, sl-security-audit, sl-delivery-validation

  ## TASK_DOCUMENTS (read ALL — source of truth)
  ${TASK_DOCUMENTS}

  ## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

  **Patterns (Critical):** IoC/DI (providers, imports, barrel exports), REST API (noun-based URLs, 201/204 codes), DTOs (class-validator, no raw objects, global validation)

  **Architecture:** Domain ← Repositories ← Services ← Controllers; no domain imports from outer; no business logic in controllers; SOLID principles (SRP, O/C, DIP)

  **Database:** Migrations with up/down; Kysely types updated; parametrized queries; no JSON.parse on JSONB (auto-parsed); no JSON.stringify before insert

  **Security (OWASP):** Parametrized queries, input validation; guards on protected routes; encrypted credentials; no sensitive logs; account_id filtering (multi-tenancy); CORS restricted; no critical npm vulnerabilities; explicit DTOs

  **Code Quality:** No `any` types, explicit returns, no console.log, no debugger, no comments, no unused imports, no magic numbers

  **Error Handling:** NestJS exceptions; throw NotFoundException (not null); descriptive messages

  **Contracts:** Backend DTOs mirrored as frontend interfaces; enums match; Date→string serialization

  **Product Validation:** For each RF/RN in about.md: verify implementation at file:line; check prerequisites (data, features, config exist); report missing (cannot auto-fix scope)

  ## RULES
  - NO questions — fix automatically
  - Use skills as source of truth
  - Missing components = CRITICAL violation
  - Missing prerequisites = CRITICAL (report, don't assume)
  - Fix ALL code violations; no deferrals
  - DO NOT run build (coordinator does it)

  ## REPORT FORMAT
  Files Reviewed, Issues by Category (Patterns, Architecture, Database, Security, Code Quality, Contracts), Issues Fixed (file:line, severity, fix), Files Modified, Product Validation (RF/RN/Prerequisites status), Product Status (PASSED/BLOCKED), Score X/10.
```

---

## STEP 5: Consolidate Findings

### 5.1 Process Reviewer Outputs

**GATE 4: ALL reviewers must return before proceeding.**

**IF a finding has unclear root cause** (symptom reported but cause not isolated, OR severity disputed between reviewers, OR finding crosses layers): LOAD .claude/skills/sl-investigation/SKILL.md and apply Phase 3 (Differential Diagnosis) before classifying severity. Do NOT auto-correct findings whose cause has not been confirmed via differential diagnosis — escalate them to the user with the diagnostic table.

**After ALL reviewers return:**

1. **Merge findings:**
   - Combine issues from Frontend + Backend reviewers
   - Deduplicate if same issue reported by multiple reviewers

2. **Aggregate metrics:**
   - Total files reviewed
   - Total issues found/fixed
   - Severity breakdown
   - Product validation status (from Backend Reviewer)

3. **Calculate overall score:**
   ```
   Frontend Score: X/10
   Backend Score: Y/10
   Overall Score: (X + Y) / 2

   Product Status: PASSED/BLOCKED
   ```

---

## STEP 6: Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected:** Build succeeds.

**If build fails:**
- Review build errors
- Identify which corrections broke the build
- Fix build errors automatically
- Re-run build
- Repeat until build passes

**GATE 5: Do NOT proceed to STEP 7 until build passes 100%.**

---

## STEP 7: Validation Gates Re-Run (INDEPENDENT)

The reviewer's job is to verify, not to trust. Existing `[x]` ticks on `## Validation Gates` are evidence of past success — they are NOT evidence of current correctness. This step re-establishes the truth.

### 7.1 Pre-condition

Read CLAUDE.md `validation_gates` block.

- **Block missing** → emit one-line nudge `Note: validation_gates not detected in CLAUDE.md. Run /sl.xray to enable validation gates.` and skip the rest of STEP 7.
- **Block present** → proceed.

### 7.2 Re-Run Procedure

Apply the **Validation Gates Procedure (review variant)** from `.claude/skills/sl-tasks-checklist/SKILL.md`:

1. Compute `TOUCHED_FILES = git diff --name-only` against the feature base.
2. For EACH `(intent, command)` in `validation_gates`:
   1. Invoke the command via Bash. Capture stdout/stderr and exit code in this session.
   2. Exit 0 → confirm `[x]` (or upgrade `[!]`/`[ ]` to `[x]`).
   3. Exit ≠ 0 → partition failures into `TOUCHED_FAILURES` vs `UNTOUCHED_FAILURES`.
      - `TOUCHED_FAILURES` non-empty → downgrade the tick to `[!] — REASON: <≤120 chars>`. **Mark review BLOCKED.** Do NOT auto-fix in review (auto-fixes belong to build); surface to user instead.
      - `UNTOUCHED_FAILURES` only → keep `[x]` and refresh `### Known Issues` (cap 10 + `+N more`).
3. Write the updated `tasks.md`.

### 7.3 Hard Requirements

- Every gate command MUST be invoked via Bash in this session before STEP 8 produces `review.md`.
- Capture each `(gate, exit_code)` pair for inclusion in the Quality Gate Report.
- Review status MUST be BLOCKED if any gate is red on a touched file after re-run.

### 7.4 Log Iteration (IF corrections applied)

**IF files were modified during review (auto-corrections):**

```bash
bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/iterations.jsonl" "fix" "/check" '"slug":"code-review","what":"Auto-corrected violations from review","files":["<list of modified files>"]'
```

Do NOT skip iteration logging if files were modified during review.

---

## STEP 8: Quality Gate Report (PRD0034)

**Consolidate all gates into review.md. This file is the merge prerequisite for /sl.done.**

### 8.1 Build Quality Gate Report

Collect results from all previous steps:

```markdown
## Quality Gate Report

| Gate | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Build | ✅ PASSED / ❌ BLOCKED | npm run build — X errors |
| Spec Compliance | ✅ PASSED / ⚠️ DIVERGENT / ❌ BLOCKED | X/Y items compliant |
| Code Review Score | ✅ PASSED / ❌ BLOCKED | X.X/10 (threshold: ≥ 7) |
| Product Validation | ✅ PASSED / ❌ BLOCKED | RF: X/X, RN: Y/Y |
| Validation Gates | ✅ PASSED / ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES / ❌ BLOCKED | One row per gate from STEP 7 with `<command> → exit <code>` (omit row if CLAUDE.md has no validation_gates) |

| **Overall** | **✅ PASSED / ❌ BLOCKED** | **Ready for merge / Issues found** |

> Reviewed at: ${TIMESTAMP}
> Reviewed by: /sl.review (model: ${MODEL})
```

**Overall = PASSED** only if ALL gates are PASSED or SKIPPED.
**Overall = BLOCKED** if ANY gate is BLOCKED.

### 8.2 Write review.md (Gate 8)

```
WRITE docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/review.md

Content:
# Review: ${FEATURE_ID}

> **Date:** ${TODAY} | **Branch:** ${BRANCH_NAME}

## Quality Gate Report
[table from 8.1]

## Spec Compliance Audit
[output from STEP 3.4]

## Code Review Summary
[aggregated findings from STEP 5]

## Product Validation
[RF/RN status from Backend Reviewer]
```

**IF review.md write failed:** Do NOT output console report. Debug and retry.

### 8.3 Console Output

Output quality gate summary including: reviewers dispatched (files reviewed per reviewer), issues found/fixed with severity breakdown, spec compliance status, product validation (RF/RN/prerequisites), scores (frontend/backend/overall), gate statuses table, link to review.md, list of modified files, and next steps (sl.done if PASSED, fix + re-check if BLOCKED).

---

## Summary of Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Check unstaged changes and ask user before staging (STEP 1)
- Load all feature docs and CLAUDE.md before dispatching reviewers (STEP 2)
- Execute spec compliance audit before technical review (STEP 3)
- Dispatch reviewers in parallel when both scopes exist (STEP 4)
- Consolidate findings with root cause analysis (STEP 5)
- Verify build passes after corrections (STEP 6)
- Re-run validation gates independently (STEP 7)
- Write review.md before console output (STEP 8)
- Track STAGED_CHANGES flag throughout execution

**NEVER:**
- Dispatch reviewers without completing Gates 1-3
- Trust existing validation gate ticks
- Stage files without explicit user permission
- Skip product validation for RF, RN, or prerequisites
- Proceed to report if build is failing
- Leave code in a non-compiling state
- Accept "it works" as justification for violations
- Skip a reviewer if files exist in that area
- Re-dispatch reviewers if build fails (Gate 5) — build fixes are follow-up corrections
