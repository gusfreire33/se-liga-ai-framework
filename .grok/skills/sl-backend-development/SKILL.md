# Backend Development

Skill for backend API implementation following universal architectural principles.

**Use for:** Routes/Controllers, Services, DTOs, Domain logic, Data access, Error handling
**Not for:** Frontend (`ux-design`), Database migrations (`database-development`), Security (`security-audit`)

**Stack resolution:** Consult `CLAUDE.md ## Architecture Contract` for the framework in use (Express, Fastify, NestJS, Hono, Elysia, etc.). Apply these principles using the framework's idiomatic patterns. The AI already knows each framework's syntax — this skill teaches architecture, not framework tutorials.

**Reference:** Always consult `CLAUDE.md` for general project standards.

---

## When NOT to Use

- **Frontend / UI work** — use `ux-design` or `sl-frontend-development` instead
- **Database migrations or schema design** — use `sl-database-development`
- **Security audits / threat modeling** — use `sl-security-audit`
- **Pure scripts, CLIs, or non-API code** — these patterns target HTTP API services
- **Greenfield architecture decisions** — use `sl-backend-architecture` to choose structure first
- **Project scaffolding** — use `sl-project-scaffolding` for initial setup

---

## Clean Architecture

```
domain → application → infrastructure → presentation
```

| Layer | Allowed deps | Content |
|---|---|---|
| domain | zero | entities, value objects, enums, types, domain errors |
| application | domain only | service interfaces, use cases, DTOs |
| infrastructure | domain, application | repository implementations, external services, config |
| presentation | all | routes/controllers, middleware, error mapping |

**Rules:**

- Lower layers NEVER import from upper layers
- Domain has ZERO I/O, ZERO framework dependencies — pure business logic
- Application layer defines interfaces (ports) — infrastructure implements them (adapters)
- Presentation layer is the only place aware of HTTP

---

## SOLID Principles

- **SRP** — Each class/module has one reason to change. Services don't handle HTTP. Repositories don't validate.
- **OCP** — Extend behavior via new implementations, not modifying existing code. Strategy/plugin patterns.
- **LSP** — Implementations must be substitutable for their interfaces without breaking behavior.
- **ISP** — Prefer small, focused interfaces. Don't force consumers to depend on methods they don't use.
- **DIP** — Services depend on interfaces, not implementations. Inject abstractions, never concrete classes.

---

## RESTful Standards

| Method | Use | Idempotent | Body | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | read | yes | no | 200 |
| POST | create | no | yes | 201 |
| PUT | full update | yes | yes | 200 |
| PATCH | partial | yes | yes | 200 |
| DELETE | remove | yes | no | 204 |

**URL rules:**

Do:

- Nouns: `/users`
- Plural: `/accounts`
- Nested: `/accounts/:id/users`
- Kebab: `/user-roles`
- Versioned: `/api/v1`

Don't:

- Verbs: `/getUsers`
- Singular: `/user`
- Mixed case: `/userRoles`

**Params:**

- Path → resource id
- Query → filter, pagination, sort, search

**Status codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | GET, PUT, PATCH ok |
| 201 | POST created |
| 204 | DELETE ok |
| 400 | validation |
| 401 | no auth |
| 403 | no permission |
| 404 | not found |
| 409 | conflict |

---

## Dependency Injection / IoC

**EVERY service, repository, and handler MUST be registered in the framework's DI container.**

Principles:

- Services receive dependencies via constructor injection
- Depend on interfaces/abstractions, never concrete implementations
- Register all components in the framework's container/module system
- Cross-module dependencies must be explicitly exported/shared

**Common DI errors:** Unresolved dependency = not registered. Cross-module failure = not exported. Route 404 = module not loaded. Consult framework docs for idiomatic registration.

---

## Naming Conventions

File naming (lookup):

| Type | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Controller / Route | `kebab.controller.ts` or `kebab.routes.ts` |
| Service | `kebab.service.ts` |
| Repository | `PascalRepository.ts` |
| Interface | `IPascalRepository.ts` |
| Entity | `Pascal.ts` |
| Enum | `PascalCase.ts` |
| DTO | `PascalDto.ts` |

Casing rules:

| Element | Casing |
|---|---|
| Files | kebab-case or PascalCase (follow project convention) |
| Classes | PascalCase |
| Interfaces | `I` + PascalCase |
| DB columns | snake_case |
| Variables | camelCase |

**Paths and aliases:** Follow the project's existing import aliases and directory structure. Do not invent new aliases — check `tsconfig.json` paths and existing code.

---

## DTOs

DTO naming:

| Action | Pattern |
|---|---|
| create | `Create[Entity]Dto` |
| update | `Update[Entity]Dto` |
| patch | `Patch[Entity]Dto` |
| response | `[Entity]ResponseDto` |
| list | `[Entity]ListResponseDto` |
| query | `[Entity]QueryDto` |

**Rules:**

- Input DTOs (`create`/`update`/`patch`) are SEPARATE from response DTOs
- Validation happens at the presentation layer entry point, NEVER in domain
- Use the project's validation library (class-validator, zod, typebox, valibot, joi, etc.)
- Every input field must have validation rules defined
- Response DTOs control what leaves the API — never expose raw entities

---

## Services

- Business logic lives here — NO HTTP concepts (no `req`/`res`, no status codes, no headers)
- Receives pure data (DTOs or primitives), returns pure data (entities or response DTOs)
- Depends on repository interfaces, not implementations
- Orchestrates domain logic — does not contain persistence logic
- One service per bounded context / feature area

---

## Repository Pattern

- Interface defined in application/domain layer
- Implementation in infrastructure layer
- Services depend on the interface, never the implementation
- Returns domain entities, not raw rows or ORM-specific objects
- All data access goes through repositories — no direct DB calls in services

---

## Error Handling

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| domain | Throw domain-specific errors (`NotFoundError`, `BusinessRuleViolationError`, `ConflictError`). No HTTP concepts. |
| application | Let domain errors propagate. Add application-level errors if needed (`ValidationError`). |
| presentation | Map domain/application errors to HTTP status codes. This is the ONLY layer that knows about HTTP. |

Error mapping:

| Domain | HTTP |
|---|---|
| `NotFoundError` | 404 |
| `ValidationError` | 400 |
| `UnauthorizedError` | 401 |
| `ForbiddenError` | 403 |
| `ConflictError` | 409 |
| `BusinessRuleViolationError` | 422 |

**Rule:** Services throw domain errors. The presentation layer (middleware, error handler, or framework mechanism) maps them to HTTP responses. Never import HTTP concepts into services.

---

## Module / Feature Structure

Organize code by domain/feature, not by technical role. Each feature module contains its own controllers, services, DTOs, and domain logic.

```
[feature]/
├── dtos/
│   ├── Create[Feature]Dto.ts
│   ├── Update[Feature]Dto.ts
│   └── [Feature]ResponseDto.ts
├── [feature].controller.ts (or routes.ts)
├── [feature].service.ts
└── [feature].module.ts (or index.ts)
```

**DDD-lite principles:**

- Entities encapsulate behavior (methods, not just data bags)
- Value objects for concepts with no identity (Money, Email, DateRange)
- Organize by bounded context, not by technical layer
- Keep domain logic in entities/services, not in controllers or repositories

---

## Multi-Tenancy

- ALWAYS filter by tenant identifier (e.g., `account_id`) at repository level
- Tenant ID extracted from auth context (JWT/session), NEVER from request body
- Super Admin may access cross-tenant data — explicitly guard this
- NEVER trust client-provided tenant ID

---

## Configuration

- **NEVER** access env vars directly in services (`process.env`, `Bun.env`, etc.)
- **ALWAYS** use a centralized, typed configuration service/module

Rules:

- Define a configuration interface with typed properties
- Load and validate config at startup
- Inject config service into consumers
- Fail fast on missing required config

---

## KISS and YAGNI

- Don't add abstraction layers you don't need yet
- Don't implement patterns the project doesn't use
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever code
- Add complexity only when requirements demand it
- Follow existing project patterns — consistency over personal preference
