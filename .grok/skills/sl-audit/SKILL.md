# Tech Audit - Complete Technical Project Audit

> **DOCUMENTATION STYLE:** Follow standards defined in skill `sl-doc-schemas`

Execute complete technical analysis of the project, identifying security, architecture, data and documentation issues. Designed for entrepreneurs using vibe coding who need a roadmap of technical adjustments.

**Output:** `docs/audit/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (per `audit-report` schema) + supporting reports in `docs/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`

> **LANG:** Respond in user's native language (detect from input). Tech terms always in English.
> **OWNER:** Adapt detail level to owner profile from status.sh (beginner → explain why; advanced → essentials only).

---

## Required Skills

Load `.claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md` before STEP 1 (schemas, IDs, universal doc rules).

## ⛔⛔⛔ MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ⛔⛔⛔

**STEPS IN ORDER:**
```
STEP 1: Create folder structure    → RUN FIRST
STEP 2: Validate prerequisites     → BEFORE discovery
STEP 3: Discovery Phase (parallel) → dispatch 3 agents, WAIT-ALL
STEP 4: Analysis Phase (parallel)  → dispatch 3 agents, WAIT-ALL
STEP 5: Consolidation              → READ all reports, apply differential diagnosis
STEP 6: Calculate scores           → BEFORE final report
STEP 7: Write audit-report doc     → schema-driven
STEP 8: Validation Gate            → audit-report schema gate
STEP 9: Inform user                → COMPLETE
```

**⛔ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (invariant):**

```
ALWAYS:
  ⛔ DO NOT: Make code corrections automatically
  ⛔ DO NOT USE: Bash for git add/commit/push
  ⛔ DO NOT: Execute analysis without project context
  ⛔ DO NOT: Skip discovery phase
  ⛔ DO NOT: Inline any doc template — schema is the only source of truth
```

## Agent Dispatch Rules & Registry

**Dispatch rules:** When instructed to DISPATCH AGENTS, read the **Capability** and **Complexity** from the agent table below. Choose the best available agent/task mechanism in your engine that satisfies the capability. If your engine supports parallel dispatch, dispatch all agents in the phase simultaneously. Verify outputs exist before proceeding past WAIT gates.

**Agent Registry:**

| Phase | Agent | Skill File | Capability | Complexity | Output |
|-------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|
| **DISCOVERY** | 1: Context | `context-discovery.md` | read-write | standard | `context-discovery.md` |
| | 2: Documentation | `documentation-analyzer.md` | read-write | standard | `documentation-report.md` |
| | 3: Infrastructure | `infrastructure-check.md` | read-write | standard | `infrastructure-report.md` |
| **ANALYSIS** | 4: Security | `security-analyzer.md` | read-write | standard | `security-report.md` |
| | 5: Architecture | `architecture-analyzer.md` | read-write | standard | `architecture-report.md` |
| | 6: Data | `data-analyzer.md` | read-write | standard | `data-report.md` |

**Idempotency:** Before each phase, check if outputs exist. If all exist and are recent (< 1 hour old), skip re-dispatch and proceed to WAIT gate. This allows recovery from transient failures without re-running heavy analysis.

---

## STEP 1: Create Folder Structure (RUN FIRST)

```bash
AUDIT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p "docs/audits/${AUDIT_DATE}"
mkdir -p "docs/audit"
```

**⛔ GATE CHECK: Folders created?**
- If NO → Stop and abort.
- If YES → Proceed to STEP 2.

---

## STEP 2: Validate Prerequisites (BEFORE discovery)

Check whether `CLAUDE.md` exists at project root. Detect project layout (look for `apps/`, `libs/`, `src/` or equivalent).

**⛔ GATE CHECK: Project structure valid?**
- If no recognisable source directories → Warn user about non-standard structure.
- If YES → Proceed to STEP 3.

---

## STEP 3: Discovery Phase (Parallel Dispatch + Wait)

**⛔ GATE CHECK: Idempotency — Skip if discovery outputs exist and are recent (< 1 hour)?**
- If all outputs exist: skip to WAIT sub-step.
- If any missing: dispatch all agents.

**DISPATCH ALL 3 AGENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY:**
Use the Agent Registry above (rows: Context, Documentation, Infrastructure). For each agent:
1. Load prompt from skill `sl-health-check` file named in Skill File column
2. Dispatch with Capability/Complexity noted
3. Instruct agent to write to output path: `docs/audits/${AUDIT_DATE}/<output>`

**⛔ WAIT-ALL: Verify outputs exist:**
- [ ] `context-discovery.md` (contains mandatory sections)
- [ ] `documentation-report.md`
- [ ] `infrastructure-report.md`

**⛔ GATE CHECK: All discovery outputs exist?**
- If NO → Do NOT proceed; wait or re-dispatch
- If YES → Proceed to STEP 4.

**⛔ GATE PROHIBITION:** DO NOT dispatch analysis agents until ALL discovery outputs verified.
**⛔ GATE PROHIBITION:** DO NOT proceed without `context-discovery.md` — it provides project context for analysis phase.

---

## STEP 4: Analysis Phase (Parallel Dispatch + Wait)

**Prerequisites:** STEP 3 completed and `context-discovery.md` exists.

**⛔ GATE CHECK: Idempotency — Skip if analysis outputs exist and are recent (< 1 hour)?**
- If all outputs exist: skip to WAIT sub-step.
- If any missing: dispatch all agents.

**DISPATCH ALL 3 AGENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY:**
Use the Agent Registry above (rows: Security, Architecture, Data). For each agent:
1. Load prompt from skill `sl-health-check` file named in Skill File column
2. **Pass context:** Provide content of `context-discovery.md` to all agents; for Security and Data agents, also pass `infrastructure-report.md`
3. Dispatch with Capability/Complexity noted
4. Instruct agent to write to output path: `docs/audits/${AUDIT_DATE}/<output>`

**⛔ WAIT-ALL: Verify outputs exist:**
- [ ] `security-report.md`
- [ ] `architecture-report.md`
- [ ] `data-report.md`

**⛔ GATE CHECK: All analysis outputs exist?**
- If NO → Do NOT proceed; wait or re-dispatch
- If YES → Proceed to STEP 5.

**⛔ GATE PROHIBITION:** DO NOT proceed to consolidation without all analysis outputs — they feed the final scoring and report.

---

## STEP 5: Consolidation & Differential Diagnosis

Read all generated reports from `docs/audits/${AUDIT_DATE}/`.

**Parse each report for:**
- Issue severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Issue description
- Impacted file/line (evidence)
- Pillar (Documentation, Security, Architecture, Data, Infrastructure)

**Differential diagnosis:** IF a finding lacks a clear root cause (symptom observable but cause not isolated, OR severity assessment is uncertain, OR finding crosses pillars): LOAD .claude/skills/sl-investigation/SKILL.md and apply Phase 3 (Differential Diagnosis) before finalizing severity. Mark such findings as `requires investigation` rather than guessing severity.

---

## STEP 6: Calculate Scores

**Per-pillar scoring:**
- Count issues by severity (Critical=3, High=2, Medium=1, Low=0.5)
- Score = max(0, 10 - (weighted_sum / 5))
- **Status:** 8-10 Healthy · 6-7 Attention · 4-5 Risk · 0-3 Critical

**Calculate:** Individual pillar scores, overall score (average), total issues by severity.

---

## STEP 7: Write audit-report Doc (Schema-Driven)

**EXECUTE schema `audit-report` from .claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md (MANDATORY).**

- **Path:** `docs/audit/${AUDIT_DATE}.md`
- **ID:** `AUDIT-${AUDIT_DATE}`; `related: [STACK]`
- Write extractive only (per schema)
- **Link supporting reports** in References section using relative paths: `../audits/${AUDIT_DATE}/*.md`

---

## STEP 8: Validation Gate

Execute the validation gate from .claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md for schema `audit-report`.

**⛔ GATE CHECK: Gate returns PASS?**
- If NO → Fix and re-run gate.
- If YES → Proceed to STEP 9.

---

## STEP 9: Completion - Inform User

Present overall scorecard, issue counts by severity, top 3 priorities, audit-report path, and suggested next steps (review report, create features for critical issues via `/sl.new`, re-run audit after fixes).

**Next Steps:** Reference skill `sl-ecosystem` Main Flows for context-aware next command suggestion.

---

## Rules

ALWAYS:
- Use accessible language for non-technical users
- Prioritize issues by real business impact
- Include specific paths and lines in Findings evidence
- Calculate scores using defined formula
- Check idempotency before each phase (STEP 3 and STEP 4) to skip redundant re-dispatch
- Execute differential diagnosis for ambiguous findings before finalizing severity

NEVER:
- Correct code automatically
- Make commits or changes to files
- Skip discovery phase
- Execute analysis without project context
- Inline a doc template — the schema is the single source of truth
- Omit file paths or line numbers in Findings evidence
- Skip validation gate (STEP 8)

---
