# Technical Planning

Skill for creating technical implementation plans. Creates/updates `plan.md` with tasks, file mapping and estimates.

**Principle:** Concrete, executable plan — not a wishlist.

---

## When to Use

- Feature documented and ready for dev → create `plan.md`
- `plan.md` exists but incomplete → fill missing tasks
- Scope changed → update affected tasks
- During dev, discovered more work → add tasks

### When NOT to Use

- Without `about.md` (document the feature first)
- Without `discovery.md` (run feature discovery first)
- Non-technical roadmaps or product timelines (use product docs instead)

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Load Context

```bash
# Read feature documentation
cat docs/features/[FEATURE_ID]/about.md
cat docs/features/[FEATURE_ID]/discovery.md
cat docs/features/[FEATURE_ID]/design.md  # if it exists
```

**Extract:**
- Requirements (RF/RNF/RN) from about.md
- Files to create/modify from discovery.md
- UI components from design.md (if any)

### Phase 2: Structure Tasks

**Breakdown rules:**

| Size | Criteria | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Simple | 1–3 files, no deps | Single task |
| Medium | 4–10 files, sequential deps | Tasks per layer |
| Large | >10 files, multiple domains | Separate batches |

**Default order (bottom-up):**
```
1. Domain (entities, enums, types)
2. Database (migrations, repositories)
3. Business (services, use-cases)
4. API (controllers, DTOs, validators)
5. Frontend (components, hooks, stores)
6. Integration (tests, e2e)
```

### Phase 3: Estimate Complexity

**Scale:**
```
S = Small  → 1-2 files, localized change
M = Medium → 3-5 files, moderate logic
L = Large  → 6+ files, complex logic
```

**Complexity signals:**
- New entities → +1 size
- Migrations → +1 size
- External integrations → +1 size
- Complex UI (forms, tables) → +1 size

### Phase 4: Structure Document

**Template plan.md (Technical Style):**

```markdown
# Plan: [Feature Name]

Technical plan for implementing [feature]. Based on about.md and discovery.md.

---

## Spec

### Context
{"feature":"[ID]","branch":"feature/[ID]-[name]","deps":["package@version"],"estimate":"[S/M/L]"}

### Files
{"create":["path/file1.ts","path/file2.ts"],"modify":["path/existing.ts"]}

### Tasks
[{"id":1,"task":"Create entity [Name]","estimate":"S","deps":[]},{"id":2,"task":"Create migration","estimate":"S","deps":[1]},{"id":3,"task":"Create repository","estimate":"S","deps":[2]},{"id":4,"task":"Create service","estimate":"M","deps":[3]},{"id":5,"task":"Create controller + DTOs","estimate":"M","deps":[4]},{"id":6,"task":"Create UI components","estimate":"M","deps":[5]},{"id":7,"task":"e2e tests","estimate":"S","deps":[6]}]

---

## Detailed Tasks

### Task 1: Create entity [Name]
**Estimate:** S
**Files:** `libs/domain/src/entities/[Name].ts`
**Deps:** None

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Fields per about.md
- [ ] Enums if needed
- [ ] Export in index.ts

---

### Task 2: Create migration
**Estimate:** S
**Files:** `libs/app-database/src/migrations/[timestamp]-[name].ts`
**Deps:** Task 1

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Table with fields
- [ ] Required indexes
- [ ] Foreign keys

---

[... continue for each task ...]

---

## Batching (if applicable)

**Batch 1: Foundation**
- Tasks 1-3 (domain + database)
- Commit: "feat([feature]): add [Name] entity and repository"

**Batch 2: Business Logic**
- Tasks 4-5 (service + API)
- Commit: "feat([feature]): add [Name] service and endpoints"

**Batch 3: Frontend**
- Task 6 (UI)
- Commit: "feat([feature]): add [Name] UI components"

**Batch 4: Quality**
- Task 7 (tests)
- Commit: "test([feature]): add e2e tests for [Name]"

---

## Risks and Mitigations

- **[Risk from discovery.md]:** [mitigation in plan]

---

## Metadata
{"updated":"YYYY-MM-DD","sessions":N,"by":"[subagent]"}
```

### Phase 5: Validate and Persist

**Checklist before saving:**
- [ ] All tasks have estimate (S/M/L)
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks are correct
- [ ] Paths are concrete and verifiable
- [ ] Batches make sense for commits
- [ ] Metadata updated

---

## Batching Strategy

| Task count | Strategy |
|------------|----------|
| <5 tasks | Single batch |
| 5–10 tasks | 2–3 batches per layer |
| >10 tasks | Batches per domain/module |

**Commit rules:** one semantic commit per batch — see `sl-commit` skill for Conventional Commits type detection and message logic.

---

## Rules

**Do:** base tasks on about.md and discovery.md; include dependencies; estimate every task (S/M/L); use concrete paths; one semantic commit per batch.

**Don't:** vague tasks ("implement feature"); estimates without criteria; ignore dependencies; plan without prior docs; batches >5 tasks.
