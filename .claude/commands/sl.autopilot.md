# Autopilot - Autonomous Feature Coordinator

> **CRITICAL RULE - 100% AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION:** This command executes planning, development, and review COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUSLY. NEVER stop to ask the user. NEVER request confirmation. Execute the ENTIRE flow until the feature is 100% implemented and building.

> **LANG:** Respond in user's native language (detect from input). Tech terms always in English.
> **OWNER:** Adapt detail level to owner profile from status.sh (beginner → explain why; advanced → essentials only).

You are the **Autopilot Coordinator** — a master orchestrator that coordinates specialized agents to deliver a complete feature from discovery to implementation, without any human intervention.

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Each agent executes its own discovery and loads context directly. Coordinator passes DECISION LOG (accumulated decisions), not raw context.

---

## REQUIRED: Skill Loading (Before All Steps)

**LOAD IMMEDIATELY — referenced by all agents:**
- `.claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md` — schemas, IDs, universal doc rules; cache rule for plan.md/about.md mutations
- `.claude/skills/sl-id-convention/SKILL.md` — ID/branch format conventions
- `.claude/skills/sl-tasks-checklist/SKILL.md` — tasks.md schema, tick rules, validator report shape
- `{{skill:sl-${AREA}-development/SKILL.md}}` — area-specific validation checklists (database, backend, frontend) — loaded dynamically by each area agent

`/sl.autopilot` is a **mutator orchestrator**: dispatched agents (planning, review) update existing `plan.md`/`about.md`. It MUST NOT allocate new IDs — reuse `[NNNN]F` from frontmatter. Every mutation MUST follow the cache rule: read existing doc → preserve valid content → complement with new info → bump `updated:` to today. `created:`, `id:`, and `type:` are immutable. After each mutation, the schema validation gate (STEP 9.5) MUST run.

---

## Agent Prompt Template Snippets (COPY-PASTE into each agent prompt)

### Agent Bootstrap Block (ALL agents use this — customize `${AREA}`)
```
## MANDATORY: Load Command & Context (FIRST STEP)
1. Read `.claude/commands/sl.build.md` (or `.claude/commands/sl.plan.md`/`.claude/commands/sl.review.md` per role)
2. Load required skills from REQUIRED section above
3. Run: `bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh`
4. Read ALL files listed in TASK_DOCUMENTS
5. IF PROJECT_SKILL in script output: run `bash .codesl/scripts/pattern-search.sh ${AREA}` and read relevant topic ranges
   IF PROJECT_DOCS in script output: read the matching project pattern files
6. Read your area's skill file: `sl-${AREA}-development`
```

### Standard Agent Prompt Section

## STEPS IN ORDER

```
STEP 1: status.sh       → RUN FIRST
STEP 2: Load Recent Context     → INTELLIGENT context loading
STEP 3: Validate Prerequisites  → about.md + discovery.md MUST exist
STEP 4: Determine Execution Mode → Epic vs Simple
STEP 5: Planning Agent          → ONLY AFTER 1-4 (or SKIP if simple)
STEP 6: Development Agents      → ONLY AFTER plan exists
STEP 7: Persist Decisions + Startup Test → Log iteration + bootstrap check
STEP 8: Review Agent            → ONLY AFTER build + startup pass
STEP 9: Compliance Gate         → Cross-reference RF/RN vs implementation
STEP 9.5: Doc Mutation Gate     → Cache rule + feature-plan/feature-about schema gate
STEP 10: Final Verification    → Build + docs + review.md check
STEP 11: Completion Report     → AUTOMATIC after verification
```

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**

```
IF DISCOVERY NOT COMPLETE (about.md missing):
  ⛔ DO NOT dispatch any agent
  ⛔ DO NOT Edit/Write code files
  ⛔ DO NOT start any development step
  ✅ DO inform user to run /feature first

IF FEATURE N REQUESTED BUT DEPENDENCY NOT MET:
  ⛔ DO NOT Edit/Write code files
  ⛔ DO NOT dispatch development agents
  ✅ DO inform that feature N-1 must be completed first

IF PLAN NOT CREATED (and not simple feature):
  ⛔ DO NOT dispatch development agents
  ⛔ DO NOT Edit/Write code files
  ✅ DO execute planning agent first

IF BUILD FAILING:
  ⛔ DO NOT dispatch review agent
  ✅ DO fix build errors first

IF STARTUP TEST FAILS (DI/IoC error, not connection):
  ⛔ DO NOT dispatch review agent
  ✅ DO fix DI error, re-run startup test

IF EXISTING DOC NOT READ (before mutating plan.md/about.md):
  ⛔ DO NOT USE: Write on plan.md or about.md
  ⛔ DO NOT: Overwrite existing content blindly
  ⛔ DO NOT: Allocate a new [NNNN]F — reuse id from frontmatter
  ✅ DO: Read full doc → preserve valid content → complement → bump updated:

IF SCHEMA NOT LOADED (before mutating plan.md/about.md):
  ⛔ DO NOT USE: Write on plan.md or about.md
  ✅ DO: Load feature-plan / feature-about from .claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md

IF DOC MUTATION GATE NOT RUN (after plan.md/about.md mutations):
  ⛔ DO NOT: Proceed to STEP 10
  ✅ DO: Run STEP 9.5 gate against each mutated doc

IF tasks.md HAS `## Validation Gates` SECTION:
  ⛔ DO NOT USE: Edit on tasks.md to tick `## Validation Gates` items WITHOUT first invoking the actual gate command via Bash and capturing its exit code in this session
  ⛔ DO NOT: Self-attest "lint passed" / "tests pass" — every tick MUST correspond to a real Bash invocation visible in the transcript
  ⛔ DO NOT: Tick `[x]` while the latest invocation of that gate exited non-zero on a file in `git diff --name-only`
  ✅ DO: Coordinator runs each gate command from CLAUDE.md → captures exit code → fixes touched-file failures → re-runs → ticks only on green; records untouched-file failures under `### Known Issues` (cap 10)

IF CLAUDE.md HAS NO `validation_gates` BLOCK:
  ⛔ DO NOT: Fabricate gate items in tasks.md
  ✅ DO: Emit ONE single line nudge: "Note: validation_gates not detected in CLAUDE.md. Run /sl.xray to enable validation gates." Continue without blocking.

ALWAYS:
  ⛔ DO NOT ask user questions (100% autonomous)
  ⛔ DO NOT wait for user confirmation
  ⛔ DO NOT use Bash for git add/commit/stage/push
  ✅ DO make all decisions autonomously (KISS/YAGNI)
  ✅ DO fix errors and continue
  ✅ DO complete 100% of the work
```

---

## Feature Flag Support (Epic)

**Syntax:** `/autopilot feature N` or `/autopilot` (executes next pending feature)

```
IF user passed "feature N":
  1. Execute ONLY the specified feature N
  2. Validate dependency: feature N-1 complete?
  3. IF NOT: BLOCK and inform

IF user did NOT pass flag + plan.md has Features (Epic):
  1. Detect last completed feature via iterations.jsonl
  2. Execute ONLY the next pending feature
  3. Inform: "Executing Feature X of Y"

IF plan.md does NOT have Features:
  1. Execute normally (simple feature)
```

---

## STEP 1: Run Context Mapper (RUN FIRST)

```bash
bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh
```

**Parse the output to get:**
- `FEATURE_ID`, `CURRENT_PHASE`
- `HAS_DESIGN`, `HAS_PLAN`, `HAS_FOUNDATIONS`
- `RECENT_CHANGELOGS` — latest finalized features with summaries
- `EPIC` — epic name (if detected)
- `FEATURES` — format `X/Y` where X=completed, Y=total
- `NEXT_FEATURE` — next feature to execute

---

## STEP 2: Load Recent Context (INTELLIGENT)

1. **Analyze RECENT_CHANGELOGS** from script output
2. **Identify matches** between the current request/feature and the summaries (common keywords, related domain, potential dependencies)
3. **If relevant match found:**
   - Check if `discovery.md` of current feature already references that feature
   - If NOT referenced: Read full changelog: `docs/features/{FEAT_ID}/changelog.md`
   - If ALREADY referenced: Skip (avoid redundancy)
4. **Extract useful context:** files created/modified, established patterns, technical decisions, correct terminology for searches

### 2.1 Cross-Feature Decisions Context (PRD0031)

**IF `.codesl/project/decisions.jsonl` exists:**
1. Read file, filter entries where `"type":"pivot"`, take last 20 entries
2. Add to Decision Log initialization as: "Previous pivots (avoid repeating):"
   - Format each: `[agent] pivoted from "[from]" → "[decision]": [reason]`

---

## STEP 3: Validate Prerequisites

- `about.md` exists? → If not, inform user to run `/feature` and STOP
- `discovery.md` exists? → If not, inform user to run `/feature` and STOP
- Feature has frontend components AND `design.md` missing? → Warn user to run `/design`

---

## STEP 4: Determine Execution Mode + Initialize Decision Log

### 4.1: Determine Mode (Epic vs Simple)

**IF `HAS_EPIC=true` (epic.md detected by status.sh — PRD0032 structure):**

- Validate requested subfeature matches EPIC_CURRENT_SF (if ahead: BLOCK)
- If no flag passed: execute EPIC_CURRENT_SF automatically
- Assemble TASK_DOCUMENTS from subfeature dir:
  - `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/subfeatures/${EPIC_CURRENT_SF}-*/about.md`
  - `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/discovery.md` (shared)
  - `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/subfeatures/${EPIC_CURRENT_SF}-*/plan.md` (if exists)
  - `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/subfeatures/${EPIC_CURRENT_SF}-*/tasks.md` (if exists)

**IF plan.md exists AND has section `## Features` (Legacy Epic):**

- Validate N == NEXT_FEATURE (dependency satisfied)
- IF N > NEXT_FEATURE: BLOCK. IF N <= completed: BLOCK (already executed)
- If no flag passed: execute NEXT_FEATURE automatically

**IF plan.md does NOT have Features:** Execution Mode: SIMPLE

### 4.2: Initialize Decision Log

Create the Decision Log that will accumulate across steps:

```markdown
### DECISION LOG - ${FEATURE_ID}

#### Initialization
- Feature: ${FEATURE_ID}
- Has Design: ${HAS_DESIGN}
- Has Plan: ${HAS_PLAN}
- Execution Mode: [SIMPLE|EPIC]
- Target: [feature number or ALL]
- Scope: [to be determined by Planning Agent]
```

### 4.3: Determine Scope (Quick Check)

Read about.md briefly to identify scope: Database? Backend? Frontend? Workers?
Update Decision Log with scope.

**NOTE:** Coordinator assembles TASK_DOCUMENTS with the correct paths (epic-aware). Agents read these docs directly.

---

## STEP 5: Planning Agent

### Skip Planning for Simple Features

If feature is very simple (single component, < 5 files, no new database entities): SKIP to STEP 6.

### Dispatch Planning Agent

**DISPATCH AGENT: @architecture-agent**
- **Output:** plan.md (frozen technical contracts in prose) + tasks.md (5-section progress checklist)
- **Prompt:**

```
## ROLE
You are the PLANNING agent for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.

## MANDATORY: Load Command + Context (FIRST STEP)
1. Read `.claude/commands/sl.plan.md` — PRIMARY reference (execute as if --yolo, skip [STOP] points).
2. Load skills: sl-doc-schemas, sl-id-convention, sl-tasks-checklist
3. Run: `bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh`
4. Read feature docs as specified in sl.plan.md

## DECISION LOG
${DECISION_LOG}

## COORDINATOR NOTES
${COORDINATOR_NOTES}

## TASK
Create complete technical plan following sl.plan.md patterns.
plan.md is FROZEN after this step — DO NOT generate `## Spec Checklist` inside plan.md.
All progress proof lives in tasks.md (5 sections per sl-tasks-checklist schema).

## RULES
- 100% of discovery details (schemas, contracts, types)
- tasks.md MUST follow sl-tasks-checklist schema exactly
- NO commits — coordinator owns Write
- 100% autonomous — never stop for confirmation

## REPORT
Plan file location, tasks.md location, key decisions, component counts per area, scope confirmed, gaps filled.
```

### Process Planning Output

1. Read the created plan.md
2. **VALIDATE** plan has all details from discovery (schemas, contracts, types)
3. Extract key decisions, update Decision Log with planning decisions
4. Check for idempotency: if plan.md exists on re-invocation, skip planning agent (re-invocation guard)

---

## STEP 6: Development Agents

### Execution Order

```
1. Database FIRST (others depend on it)
   → Wait → Dispatch Database Validator → Wait
   → Update Decision Log (idempotency check: skip if db files exist)

2. Backend + Frontend in PARALLEL (if both needed)
   → Send BOTH dispatches in SINGLE message
   → Wait → Dispatch Backend Validator + Frontend Validator in PARALLEL → Wait
   → Update Decision Log (idempotency check: skip if area files exist)

3. Build Verification (after ALL validators)
```

### Development Agent Dispatch Pattern

**Dispatch flow:**
1. DATABASE agent (DATABASE-AGENT) → DATABASE validator
2. BACKEND + FRONTEND agents in PARALLEL → validators in PARALLEL
3. Coordinators merges validator reports → Quality Gates procedure

**Idempotency:** Before dispatching area agent, check git for existing area files. If found, SKIP (already executed).

**Agent Prompt Template** (fill in the row from table below):

```
## ROLE
You are the ${AREA} developer for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.

## MANDATORY: Load Command & Context (FIRST STEP)
1. Read `.claude/commands/sl.build.md` (scope: LIMITED to ${AREA}).
2. Load: sl-doc-schemas, sl-id-convention, sl-${AREA}-development
3. Run: `bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh` and read TASK_DOCUMENTS
4. IF PROJECT_SKILL/PROJECT_DOCS: load via pattern-search.sh ${AREA}
5. Load your area's skill (contains Validation Checklist)

## DECISION LOG
${DECISION_LOG}

## COORDINATOR NOTES
${COORDINATOR_NOTES}

## TASK
[From table: AREA_SPECIFIC_TASK]
Search codebase for reference files. Update all barrel exports.

## RULES
- 100% of plan.md specs, NO deferrals, NO questions
- Build MUST pass after changes
- Log pivots: bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh ...

## REPORT
[From table: AREA_REPORT]
```

**Area Details:**

| AREA | AGENT | AREA_SPECIFIC_TASK | AREA_REPORT |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| DATABASE | @database-agent | Implement entity, enum, types, migration, repository per plan.md | FILES_CREATED, FILES_MODIFIED, MIGRATION_NAME, BUILD_STATUS |
| BACKEND | @backend-agent | Implement module, DTOs, commands, events, controller, service per plan.md. Register module. | FILES_CREATED, FILES_MODIFIED, ENDPOINTS, BUILD_STATUS, DTO_CONTRACTS |
| FRONTEND | @frontend-agent | Implement types, hooks, store, components, pages per plan.md+design.md. Update routes. (If NO design.md: also load sl-ux-design) | FILES_CREATED, FILES_MODIFIED, ROUTES_ADDED, BUILD_STATUS |

### Validator Dispatch Pattern

**After EACH area implementation completes, dispatch validator.**

**Idempotency:** Check iterations.jsonl. If validator-${AREA} logged today, SKIP.

**Validator Prompt Template:**

```
## ROLE
You are the ${AREA} VALIDATOR for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.
Validate code, audit plan.md compliance, emit JSON TICK REPORT (NOT tasks.md — coordinator owns writes).

## MANDATORY: Load Context
1. Run: bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh
2. Load: sl-tasks-checklist, sl-${AREA}-development
3. Read: plan.md (contracts), tasks.md (checklist), implemented files

## IMPLEMENTED FILES
${FILES_CREATED}
${FILES_MODIFIED}

## DECISION LOG
${DECISION_LOG}

## TASK A — Skill Checklist Validation
Extract "## Validation Checklist" from sl-${AREA}-development. Read ALL files. Validate each item — fix violations immediately. Verify build.

## TASK B — Spec Compliance + Tick Report
Follow Tick Application Procedure in sl-tasks-checklist. Emit JSON per Validator Report Shape (area, ticks, files_inspected, checklist_results, violations_found/fixed, build_status, spec_status).

## RULES
- NO questions — fix violations automatically
- Checklist violations = MUST FIX
- Build MUST pass after fixes
- DO NOT EDIT tasks.md — emit JSON only

## REPORT
JSON from sl-tasks-checklist Validator Report Shape
```

### Coordinator Merge Procedure (Validator Reports)

After each batch of per-area validators returns:
1. Run **Coordinator Merge Procedure** from `sl-tasks-checklist` skill
2. Write merged ticks to `tasks.md` (coordinator is sole writer)
3. Update Decision Log with violations found/fixed, files modified, build status, ticks applied/failed
4. Idempotency check: if all areas validated, skip re-validation on re-invocation

### Build Verification & Auto-Fix

**STEP 6.A:** Run project build. If fails:
- Dispatch Fix Agent with error output + Decision Log (idempotency: check if fix already attempted; log attempt number)
- Re-run build
- Max 2 attempts; if still failing, report blocked status with error

**Fix Agent Dispatch (inline — for build errors only)**
```
## ROLE
Fix BUILD ERRORS for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.

## MANDATORY: Context
1. Load skills: sl-doc-schemas, sl-id-convention
2. Run: `bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh`

## Error Output
[paste build error output]

## DECISION LOG
${DECISION_LOG}

## TASK
Fix ALL build errors. Focus on syntax, imports, types — not logic changes.
Run build after each fix. Do not stop until build passes 100%.
Log attempt: `bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/decisions.jsonl" "fix" "build" '"attempt":[N],"error":"[type]","resolution":"[what fixed]"'`

## RULES
- NO questions — fix autonomously
- Build MUST pass
- Syntax/imports/types only — no logic changes

## REPORT
FILES_MODIFIED, BUILD_STATUS, ERRORS_FIXED, FINAL_EXIT_CODE
```

### Quality Gates Tick (END OF BUILD)

After ALL area validators return AND build verification passes:
- Run **Quality Gates Procedure** from `sl-tasks-checklist` (final §5 ticks + final §1 recompute, single write)
- Idempotency check: if gates already ticked, skip rerun

---

## STEP 7: Persist Decisions + Application Startup Test

### 7.1 Persist Iteration Log (idempotent)

After ALL development + validation completes, log iteration:
```bash
bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/iterations.jsonl" "add" "/autopilot" '"slug":"<FEATURE_SLUG>","what":"<WHAT max 60 chars>","files":["<list from Decision Log>"]'
```

**Idempotency:** Check iterations.jsonl first. If latest entry is from TODAY and has same FEATURE_ID + "/autopilot", skip relogging.

**IF HAS_EPIC=true, also create git tag checkpoint:**
```bash
git tag "${FEATURE_ID}-${EPIC_CURRENT_SF}-done"
```
Update epic.md subfeature status to `in_progress` (will move to `done` after `/sl.done`).

### 7.2 Application Startup Test (idempotent)

Validates IoC/DI at runtime — build passing does not mean app starts.

**Idempotency:** Check if STARTUP_CHECK already logged as PASSED or SKIPPED in iterations.jsonl for TODAY. If yes, skip.

```
1. CHECK: does `start:test` exist in package.json scripts?
2. IF NOT EXISTS:
   a. ANALYZE project: framework, entry point, bootstrap method
   b. CREATE ./scripts/bootstrap-check.ts
      Must: bootstrap completely, NOT listen()/serve(), exit(0) OK, exit(1) error
   c. ADD to package.json: "start:test": "ts-node ./scripts/bootstrap-check.ts"
3. EXECUTE: npm run start:test
4. IF exit code 0: STARTUP_CHECK: PASSED → proceed to STEP 8
5. IF exit code 1:
   - DI/IoC error → AUTO-FIX (add missing provider), re-run. If still failing: BLOCKED, log attempt
   - Connection error (DB/Redis unavailable) → STARTUP_CHECK: SKIPPED (environment-specific)

Log result:
bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/iterations.jsonl" "test" "startup" '"status":"[PASSED|SKIPPED|BLOCKED]","attempt":[N]'
```

---

## STEP 8: Review Agent

**GATE CHECK:** Build MUST be passing AND Startup Test MUST be PASSED/SKIPPED before dispatching review.
**Idempotency Guard:** If review.md exists, skip review agent.

**DISPATCH AGENT: @reviewer-agent**
- **Output:** review.md with Quality Gate Report
- **Prompt:**

```
## ROLE
You are the CODE REVIEWER for feature ${FEATURE_ID}.
Validate code AND product (requirements 100% implemented).

## MANDATORY: Load Command & Context
1. Read `.claude/commands/sl.review.md` — PRIMARY reference (execute as --yolo, skip [STOP] points, no confirmations).
2. Load skills: sl-doc-schemas, sl-id-convention, sl-tasks-checklist
3. Run: `bash .codesl/scripts/status.sh`
4. Read feature docs as specified in sl.review.md
5. Read: `docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/decisions.jsonl` (areas with multiple pivots need extra review)

## DECISION LOG (COMPLETE)
${COMPLETE_DECISION_LOG}
Contains FILES_CREATED and FILES_MODIFIED from all agents.

## COORDINATOR NOTES
${COORDINATOR_NOTES}

## TASKS

### A — Spec Compliance Audit (BEFORE technical review)
1. Read contracts from plan.md prose (routes, services, DTOs, queues, guards) — all areas
2. Read tick state from tasks.md → ## Acceptance Checklist; §1 ## Requirements Coverage shows derived RF/RN coverage
3. For EACH ## Acceptance Checklist item: locate implementation (file:line), validate existence AND behavior; cross-check tick `[x]` vs reality
4. Cross-reference: every RF/RN in tasks.md §1 has ≥1 §4 item? Every RF/RN from about.md appears in §1?
5. Status per item: COMPLIANT | DIVERGENT | FAILED | PENDING | STALE TICK

### B — Generate Quality Gate Report
Create docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/review.md with:
- Quality Gate table (Build, Spec Compliance, Code Review Score, Product Validation, Startup Test, Overall)
- Overall = PASSED only if ALL gates are PASSED or SKIPPED
- Auto-fix critical issues (missing components, broken contracts, failed requirements)

## RULES
- 100% of requirements implemented, NO deferrals
- Missing components from plan = CRITICAL, MUST FIX
- Build MUST pass after fixes
- review.md MUST be created (merge prerequisite for /sl.done)
- NO questions — fix issues autonomously

## REPORT
SPEC_ITEMS, SPEC_COMPLIANT, SPEC_DIVERGENT, SPEC_MISSING, FILES_REVIEWED, ISSUES_FOUND, ISSUES_FIXED, BUILD_STATUS, CODE_SCORE, RF_IMPLEMENTED, RN_IMPLEMENTED, PRODUCT_STATUS, REVIEW_MD_PATH, OVERALL_STATUS, BLOCKED_GATES
```

---

## STEP 9: Coordinator Compliance Gate

**[HARD STOP] — DO NOT report completion without executing this step.**

**Idempotency:** Check iterations.jsonl for compliance-gate entry from TODAY with status PASSED. If found, SKIP.

1. Re-read TASK_DOCUMENTS (about.md, plan.md) to extract RF/RN list
2. Cross-reference each RF/RN against FILES_CREATED/FILES_MODIFIED from Decision Log
3. Quick-read relevant implementation files to confirm requirement exists in code
4. IF any RF/RN has no corresponding implementation:
   - List missing items
   - Dispatch fix agent with missing requirements + TASK_DOCUMENTS
   - Re-run this gate after fix
   - Log attempt: `bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/iterations.jsonl" "gate" "compliance" '"result":"[PASSED|NEEDS_FIX]","missing":[count]'`
5. IF ALL RF/RN covered: proceed to STEP 10

---

## STEP 9.5: Doc Mutation Gate (idempotent)

Any mutation to `plan.md` or `about.md` executed by dispatched agents MUST obey the **cache rule** from `.claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md`:
- Read full doc first. Capture `id: [NNNN]F`, `created:`, `type:` — immutable.
- Preserve valid content. Only complement with new findings. Never allocate new ID.
- Bump `updated:` to today on every write.

**Idempotency:** Check iterations.jsonl for doc-mutation-gate entry from TODAY. If status PASSED for both docs, skip.

For EACH mutated doc (`plan.md` and/or `about.md`):
1. Execute validation gate from `.claude/skills/sl-doc-schemas/SKILL.md` for corresponding schema (`feature-plan` or `feature-about`)
2. Verify immutable fields (`id:`, `type:`, `created:`) were preserved

**[HARD STOP]** If any gate FAILS: dispatch fix agent with gate output, re-run, and do NOT advance to STEP 10 until all gates return PASS.

Log: `bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/iterations.jsonl" "gate" "doc-mutation" '"docs":["plan.md","about.md"],"status":"[PASSED|FAILED]"'`

---

## STEP 10: Final Verification + Validation Gates

**Idempotency:** Check iterations.jsonl for final-verification entry from TODAY with status PASSED. If found, skip to STEP 11.

### 10.1 Project Build & Doc Existence Check
Run project build. Verify expected docs in feature directory:
- Required: `about.md`, `discovery.md`, `plan.md`, `review.md`
- Optional: `design.md`

Checklist: Build passes, all expected docs exist, review.md has Quality Gate Report, review status is READY (not BLOCKED).

### 10.2 Validation Gates Tick (Coordinator-Only Write)

The coordinator (NOT area validators) is the sole writer of `## Validation Gates` ticks. Run **Validation Gates Procedure** from `.claude/skills/sl-tasks-checklist/SKILL.md`:

1. Read CLAUDE.md `validation_gates` block.
   - Missing? → emit one-line nudge: "Note: validation_gates not detected in CLAUDE.md. Run /sl.xray to enable validation gates." Skip rest of 10.2.
2. For each `(intent, command)`: invoke via Bash, capture exit code.
3. Exit ≠ 0 → partition failures via `git diff --name-only` against feature base
   - Touched-file failures → dispatch fix agent, re-run, tick `[x]` only on green
   - Untouched-file failures → append to `### Known Issues` (cap 10 + `+N more`), mark `[!] — REASON: …`
4. Single coordinator write to `tasks.md` with merged ticks

**Hard rule:** every gate command MUST be invoked via Bash in this session before any `[x]` tick. Self-attestation forbidden.

Log: `bash .codesl/scripts/log-jsonl.sh "docs/features/${FEATURE_ID}/iterations.jsonl" "gate" "validation-gates" '"gates_run":[count],"gates_passed":[count],"status":"[PASSED|PARTIAL|BLOCKED]"'`

---

## STEP 11: Completion Report (Auto-Generated)

Generate contextual report summarizing execution:

**Sections:**
- Execution summary (steps completed, mode [Simple|Epic], feature ID, time elapsed)
- Components (file counts: Database/Backend/Frontend)
- Key decisions (highlights from Decision Log)
- Quality gates (overall status: PASSED or BLOCKED with reasons)
- Validation summary (Code Review score, Spec Compliance, RF/RN coverage, Startup Test result)
- Next steps (review changes, test manually, /sl.done)

**Epic Mode:**
- Feature N of M, epic name
- Subfeature deliverables + completion criteria

**If BLOCKED:**
- Blocked gates with reasons + required actions to unblock

---

## Coordinator Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Load all skills from REQUIRED section before STEP 1
- Use Agent Prompt Template snippets (avoid duplication)
- Dispatch validators after each area implementation
- Propagate complete Decision Log to all agents (accumulated from previous steps)
- Update Decision Log after every agent: extract decisions + files
- Leave changes unstaged for user review
- When dispatching multiple independent agents: send ALL in SINGLE message
- Check idempotency gates before each step (skip if already done today)

**NEVER:**
- Pass pre-processed context instead of Decision Log
- Skip Agent Bootstrap block in prompts
- Execute git add/commit/stage/push
- Defer violations to review — fix in validation phase
- Skip Doc Mutation Gate (STEP 9.5) after agent writes to plan.md/about.md
- Allow validators to edit tasks.md directly (JSON reports only; coordinator merges)

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| about.md not found | STOP — inform user to run /feature |
| discovery.md not found | STOP — inform user to run /feature |
| plan.md creation fails | Retry planning agent once, then report error |
| Build fails after development | Dispatch Fix Agent automatically |
| Build fails after fix | Dispatch Fix Agent with higher complexity |
| Review reports BLOCKED | Report blocked items with required actions |
| Agent timeout | Report partial progress, suggest manual continuation |
| Feature N dependency not met | STOP — inform user which feature must complete first |
